  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    WriteBoost is designed to enhance your writing experience. 
    We strive to minimize the collection of personal data. Specifically:

    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Some non-personal information, such as error logs or performance metrics, may be collected to improve stability and performance. This data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Text that you enter or highlight in the extension is processed locally in your browser. Unless explicitly stated, this text is not transmitted to external servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    Any information collected is used strictly for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate and improve the functionality of the WriteBoost extension.</li>
    <li>To respond to user inquiries and provide technical support.</li>
    <li>To analyze anonymous usage trends to make improvements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We do not store personal or sensitive data on our servers. 
    Any text processed by WriteBoost remains in your local browser environment unless you explicitly choose to share it with us for support purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. 
    However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    WriteBoost is not directed at children under the age of 13. 
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. 
    If we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will delete it promptly.
